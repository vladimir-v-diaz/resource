<Return value notes>
  The dictionary returned by measure_resources() is used by
  benchmark_resources.py and contains a value for every system resource.
  If the system resource is successfully measured, then the measured value
  of that resource is returned as an integer. If a test fails, then a
  string describing the failure is returned for that resource. If the
  resource is not currently being measured, then None is returned.

  Formerly, None was returned for both failed and unimplemented tests, but
  this made it impossible to determine whether a benchmark had actually
  failed or if it was simply not being measured.

<Resource events>
  WARNING the 'events' resource is hardcoded to a value of 500
  
  The 'events' resource has proven very difficult to measure across the
  different operating systems, and on some it is infeasible to measure.
  The decision has been made to take 500 events for the node
  
  see benchmark_resources for more information.

  Generates some resource info for Windows and Windows Mobile

  Windows Mobile Info

  CPU's: 1
  Max Processes: 32
  Max Threads: Bound by Memory, default is 1 meg per tread, so 32 max
  This would essentially leave no memory for anything else, so lets do 1/4
  See: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb202727.aspx
  Max Memory: Windows Mobile 5 limit is 32 megs per app
  Mobile 6 is 1 gig, but lets play it safe
  http://www.addlogic.se/articles/articles/windows-ce-6-memory-architecture.html
  I can't find a handle limit for Mobile, but lets just use 1/4 of desktop (50)
  Windows Mobile 6 has a 64K handle limit (system wide)

  Windows Info
  CPU's: %NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS%
  Processes: I think I remember 32K
  Threads: 512 default, we will probably hit a memory limit first so...
  Lets do 1/4 of this, times the number of CPU's
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684957.aspx
  Max Memory: 4 gigs on 32bit, but getMem info can handle up to 64 gig for 64bit machines
  64 sockets per app by default, see: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa923605.aspx

  See: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/327699
  Total user objects can be between 200 and 18K per proc
  System limit of 64K
  See: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms725486(VS.85).aspx
  So, lets use the lowest possible to play it safe
  64 sockets per app by default, see: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms739169(VS.85).aspx

  libc._getmaxstdio() gives us the maximum number of file handles

  Loopback is a special case of network, we can do the same benchmark with a local addr
